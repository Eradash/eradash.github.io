I'm creating my website!

This is something I wanted to do for a long time, and now I'm doing it! I am trying Jekyll
for now, and will add more and more things like themes and plugins over time. I want to
keep it static, just for the kick of it. If you have comments or tricks for me, don't
hesitate to reach out! ;)
