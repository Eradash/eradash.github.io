ReactiveX is a framework for reactive programming based ont the Observable pattern.
It is available for a ton of languages, and concepts are detailed in the documentation for all implementations.

For more information, you can check my [slides](https://eradash.github.io/files/reactivex_presentation.pdf), or check the official documentation [here](http://reactivex.io/).

Have fun!

_I will add more info when I will have the time_
